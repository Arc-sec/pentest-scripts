# Requirements

# my.bruteforce
Using ffuf to bruteforce target

	sudo my.bruteforce -r request.txt -u users.txt -p passlist.txt

# my.recon
Slightly more complex script, idea is to automate Domain / Subdomain / Directory / File discovery on target. 
This one needs more work to be usable. Ooh well maby in future will have more time.
